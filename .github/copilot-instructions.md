# Technical Notes

- This project authenticates users using JWT tokens which are attached to the
  HTTP header `X-Access-Token`.
- This project uses user secrets for storing sensitive information like
  connection strings and API keys. So you can't find any connection strings or
  similar things in appsettings files. Just ask me if you need to add or edit a
  secret info.
